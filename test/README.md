In-progress development of webdriver tests.

Requires node & npm installed. Developed on node version 10.

Run them like this:

```bash
npm install
node test/specs/login.js --url=http://localhost:8081 --user=Test --password=test
```

Replacing url, user and password with the details for the scratchpad under test

NB: User name is currently case sensitive!

More instructions on how to write the tests to come...
